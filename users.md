## Our users
- *Jana says:* As a long-time redditor who lurks a lot but comments little, I want to see lots of satisfying statistics about the website so that I can amuse myself and waste a bit of time at work. I like playing with new web toys that developers come up with, but they're fundamentally useless timewasters.
- *Sam says*: As a new redditor who has been here for a week and is still disoriented by the wild variation in tone across the site, I want to be able to get statistics about the way people behave in different subreddits, to validate my hunch that certain subreddits are better corners of the internet for me to hang out in, and that some are just plain nasty.
- *Ming says:* As a moderator of /r/Singapore which nobody likes spending time in, I would like to view trends in the sub so that I can identify what's going wrong in it and come up with ideas for making the sub more appealing.
- *Ali says:* As a first-time visitor to the reddit site and the Thingamajig, I am very confused. I want to know what the hell is going on so I can understand why my coworker sent me links to these two websites. 

## Jana's journey

- Jana is bored at work. She uses her smartphone (work PC blocks reddit) to go on reddit and checks 'new': someone has submited a new toy they made. Jana clicks on it.
- Jana arrives on the T website. She sees that a few other people have been requesting stats about other subreddits, including /r/cats, one of her favorites.
- She reads through the statistics about /r/cats for a while. Apparently the users of /r/cats are more upvote-happy than average, and they also have lots of discussion on posts instead of just posting links to resources. She isn't surprised, but this is mildly interesting, and more interesting than work.
- She reads through the statistics for a few other subs, then tries running the T-bot on her favorite sub /r/talesfromtechsupport. She is gratified to see that TFTS now appears on the list of recently explored subs for other users to explore. She's made a contribution!
- When the stats for TFTS load, she finds that she's one of the most downvote-happy people in the sub. She's annoyed at the site for pointing this out, but decides that she should think before she downvotes in the future.
- She explores a few more subs and then puts her phone away. Back to work.

## Sam's journey

- Sam is having a relaxing weekend spent in pyjamas on the couch with her laptop. She decides to go to reddit to look for more subreddits that she can subscribe to, because her friend told her that doing so was the key to making it interesting.
- She realizes that country subreddits probably exist and, excitedly, puts in /r/Singapore. However, after reading through it for a bit, she gets a feeling that it's low-quality and not very active. She makes a friendly self-introductory post anyway, because she feels that her countrymen should band together on the internet.
- Sam goes through a few other subreddits for her other interests. /r/TolkienFans seems to be not very active, but a place where thoughtful intellectual discussion exists.
- She notices that there has been a reply to her post in /r/Singapore. She goes back to the post and someone has said that her post was 'a waste of space', and she has gotten 2 upvotes to 15 downvotes. Sam is angry and sad. She wonders if her hunch is true or if everyone is just being particularly mean to her.
- She does a web search for 'reddit jerks' and finds someone talking about the T website. She clicks on the link and finds the website.
- The site claims to be able to give you hard numbers about the behavior of users in a subreddit. She notices that you can explore other subs that people have recently looked at, but she wants to know what /r/Singapore is like, and types it in and hits 'go'.
- The results are in, and she feels vindicated. She also sees that it's easy to share results. 
- She shares the up-downvote ratio statistic and the list of most downvote-happy users on /r/Singapore and on Facebook, adding a comment that she's leaving the sub and that she's disappointed and embarrassed to share a nationality with such mean people. She goes back to the T site to check out /r/TolkienFans and has her hunch validated again.
- She spends the rest of the day on /r/TolkienFans.

## Ming's journey

- Ming founded /r/Singapore and left it to fester for a while. Now he's back and is facing complaints that the subreddit. In fact, a new user just left, and she posted some statistics from a website that he is curious about.
- Ming gets on his computer in case the website isn't mobile-friendly, and goes to the website. He sees that /r/Singapore is on the list of recently explored subs and v iews it.
- It appears that his users are extremely downvote-happy, both on posts and on comments. In particular, /u/jerkface has downvoted every single post ever made on the sub.
- He sees a special note to moderators in the corner and expands it. The note gives him some suggestions for what he can do based on the behavior that his users seem to be exhibiting.
- Ming goes back to the subreddit and posts a new mod post warning people against excessive downvoting and the hazing of new members. He also messages /u/jerkface with a warning, and the new user who left with an apology. He hopes that this will help.

## Ali's journey
- Eh, we'll do this later. Sorry, Ali.
